# CycleBoard

### Welcome to CycleBoard

To start the project run these commands:

```bash
pnpm bootstrap
pnpm launch:app
```

Backend: `http://localhost:4000/`

Frontend: `http://localhost:3000/`

You may need to refresh your navigator after the server started.

### Troubleshooting

If you have issues with lerna and npm client you can edit `./lerna.json` and add the npm client you prefer:
```json
{
  "packages": [
    ".",
    "./server"
  ],
  "npmClient": "ADD YOU NPM CLIENT HERE",
  "version": "0.0.0"
}
```

If it still doesn't work you can start the project the old way:

Server:
```bash
cd server
pnpm dev
```
Frontend:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Issues / What I would have done if I had more time

I had an issue with the exports from Figma so I decided to use [@mui/icon-material](https://mui.com/components/material-icons) to replace them.

There is an issue with some types in files `containers/Board.tsx` and `components/SidebarMenu.tsx`. The issue comes from the code generated by `@graphql-codegen`but I didn't find a way to fix this yet .

If you go to `/Roadmap-Tech` or `/Improvements` it will log a lot of errors in the console but it's "normal". It's just because I was too lazy in the creation of the mocked backend and reuse the same cards multiple time, so there is some duplicated keys.
I will try to take time to fix this.

And finally if I had more time this is what I would have done:

- Unit testing (with jest and @testing-library)
- Add elements to my theme to avoid using magic numbers
- Remove `@mui/*` and created my own theme / `Typography` component
